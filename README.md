# Medical-DNA-Analyzerüë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüß¨ü©∫‚ù§
A Python-based tool for simplified DNA analysis focused on medical applications, making it practical for doctors and healthcare providers to analyze genetic data in the context of various medical conditions..

## Overview

This tool allows the analysis of DNA sequences to detect common disease-associated mutations, genetic risk factors, and drug metabolism profiles. It generates clinical reports and visual summaries to aid in healthcare decision-making. The tool is designed to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights derived from DNA sequences.

## Features

**Mutation Detection:** Identifies common mutations associated with diseases like Breast Cancer, Cystic Fibrosis, and Lynch Syndrome.

**Risk Factor Analysis:** Assesses genetic risk for cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's, and more.

**Drug Metabolism Profiling:** Analyzes genes related to drug metabolism, including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and TPMT.

**Clinical Report Generation:** Automatically compiles a clinical report with findings and recommendations.

**Visualization:** Generates plots to visualize detected mutations, risk levels, and drug metabolism profiles.

## Installation
